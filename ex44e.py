# Views on Inheritance or Composition
# 1. Avoid multiple inheritance at all costs, as it’s too complex to be reliable. If # you’re stuck with it,
# then be prepared to know the class hierarchy and spend time finding where everything # is coming from.
# 2. Use composition to package code into modules that are used in many different # # unrelated places and situations.
# 3. Use inheritance only when there are clearly related reusable pieces of code that # fit under a single
# common concept or if you have to because of something you’re using.
